# Salary Predictor – Linear Regression from Scratch

This project implements a linear regression model **entirely from scratch using Python and NumPy** to predict salaries based on years of experience. The goal is to understand how a simple linear model is built, trained, and evaluated without relying on machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.


## Project Overview

- Load and visualize a real-world dataset (Experience vs Salary).
- Standardize features using Z-score normalization.
- Build a custom linear regression model using gradient descent.
- Evaluate model performance using the R² score.
- Plot the best fit line and cost convergence.



## Dataset

- **Source**: [Salary Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishek14398/salary-dataset-simple-linear-regression)
- **Columns**:
  - `YearsExperience`
  - `Salary`



## Tech Stack

- **Python** (Core programming)
- **NumPy** (Matrix operations and gradient descent)
- **matplotlib** (Data visualization)
- **pandas** (CSV loading and data wrangling)



##  Running the Project
